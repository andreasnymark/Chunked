Slab No. 1 (formely Chunked) started as project to add diacritical marks and to expand the open source font Chunk, by [Meredith Mandel](http://www.meredithmandel.com/). 

As my work on the regular weight progressed, the design evolved and I decided to redraw the black weight, initially intended to be an expanded version of Chunk.
