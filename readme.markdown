## Based on Chunk

Chunk, by [Meredith Mandel](http://www.meredithmandel.com/), is an ultra-bold slab serif typeface that is reminiscent of old American Western woodcuts, broadsides, and newspaper headlines. Used mainly for display, the fat block lettering is unreserved yet refined for contemporary use.

## Slab № 1

Slab № 1 (formely Chunked) started as project to expand upon Chunk with a greater set of glyphs. Now I’m also adding more weights. This is work in progress.

## Slab № 1 Regular
